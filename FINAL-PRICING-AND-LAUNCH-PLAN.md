• That's it.

Why This Benefits Your Server:

2. "We have exclusive checkout service" = competitive advantage

4. Zero cost to you - I handle ALL support, tech, billing

[Your Name]
```

**Expected Response Rate:** 20% (4 out of 20 servers respond)
**Expected Yes Rate:** 50% (2 out of 4 say yes)
**Total: 2-3 Discord partnerships from 20 outreach emails**

## 💳 Payment Processing: Stripe

**Why Stripe:**
- ✅ 2.9% + $0.30 (vs PayPal's 3.49% + $0.49)
- ✅ Professional, trusted platform
- ✅ Best developer API
- ✅ Supports Apple Pay, Google Pay
- ✅ Built-in fraud detection
- ✅ Volume discounts at $10k+/month

**Stripe Cost Impact:**
- At 100 customers: $115/month (6% of revenue)
- At 500 customers: $576/month (6% of revenue)
- At 1,000 customers: $1,151/month (6% of revenue)

**Alternative: PayPal (backup option)**
- Offer for customers without credit cards
- Higher fees (3.49% + $0.49) = $164/month at 100 customers
- **Cost you $49/month more than Stripe**

**DO NOT USE: Zelle, Cash App, Venmo**

## ⚠️ Critical Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Can't Find Discord Partners
**Probability:** Low (Pokemon community is huge, many servers exist)
**Mitigation:**
- Reach out to 50+ servers, not just 20
- Offer first 50 customers free first checkout
- Show demo video upfront (builds credibility)
- **Backup:** Fall back to Reddit organic growth (slower, but works)

### Risk 2: Low Conversion in Discord
**Probability:** Medium (1-2% is industry standard, might be lower)
**Mitigation:**
- Offer Discord-exclusive promo (first checkout free)
- Partner with Discord influencers in server
- Run first-week contest ("First 10 to use service get $20 credit")
- **Backup:** Need 2-3 Discords instead of 1-2

### Risk 3: Success Rate <70%
**Probability:** Medium (retailer anti-bot measures are strong)
**Mitigation:**
- Start with easiest retailer (Pokemon Center)
- Use residential proxies ($680/month)
- Implement behavioral mimicry
- Continuous optimization
- **Backup:** Lower pricing temporarily to 5% until success rate improves

### Risk 4: Stripe Account Hold/Freeze
**Probability:** Medium (new accounts often held)
**Mitigation:**
- Build up Stripe history slowly (start with beta users)
- Be transparent about business model in Stripe application
- Have 2-3 months runway to handle rolling 7-day payouts
- **Backup:** PayPal Business account as backup processor

### Risk 5: Burn Through Savings Before Breakeven
**Probability:** Low ($388/month burn for 2-3 weeks = $776-1,164 total)
**Mitigation:**
- Have $2,000 in savings before launch
- Can hit 75 customers in 3-4 weeks with Discord
- **Backup:** Pre-sell to first 20 customers (pay upfront for 10 checkouts)

---

## 💰 Investment Required

**Total Investment to Breakeven (45 customers):**
- Customer acquisition: **$0** (Discord partnership)
- Burn period (1-2 weeks at $71/month): **$71-142**
- Misc (domain, demo video): **$50-100**
- **TOTAL: ~$150-250** 🔥

**This is 95%+ less than traditional customer acquisition ($2,250-4,500 to reach 45 customers with ads)**

**You can literally launch this business with $250 and be profitable in 2-3 weeks!**

## 📞 FAQ

**Q: Why 7% instead of 5%?**
A: 7% allows breakeven at 75 customers vs 200 with 5%. Still 2-4x cheaper than personal shoppers (15-30%) and 7-28x cheaper than scalpers (50-200%).

**Q: Why no monthly fee?**
A: Removes barrier to entry. Makes it easy for Discord communities to promote. Customers feel zero risk ("I only pay if it works").

**Q: Why Discord partnership vs paid ads?**
A: $0 acquisition cost vs $50-100 per customer. Built-in trust from community. 10x faster growth (3-4 weeks to breakeven vs 3-6 months).

**Q: What if Discord servers say no?**
A: Reach out to 50+ servers. Fall back to Reddit organic growth (slower but free). Offer incentives (first checkout free, revenue share if needed).

**Q: Why no revenue share with Discord?**
A: They benefit from having premium service for their community. You handle all support, tech, billing. Win-win without money changing hands. (Can offer 5-10% if needed to close deal.)

**Q: Why Stripe vs cheaper alternatives?**
A: Professional appearance, scales to millions, better API, volume discounts. Worth the 2.9% + $0.30 for reliability and automation.
